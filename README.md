# Building an ERP with BPMN &amp; Workflow Engines

## TuKSS2021 Group Project #4 Intro

Get to know the technologies used in this project:

- Install the Camunda Platform (the open-source workflow engine, we recommend using Docker) & the Camunda modeler: https://camunda.com/download/
- Follow the Camunda Quick Start guide: https://docs.camunda.org/get-started/quick-start/
- We recommend you follow the examples using JavaScript and NodeJS in the Quick Start Guide
- Note any observations you make along the way (feedback for the Camunda folks)
- Join the [Camunda University Slack](https://camunda-university.slack.com), search the [Camunda Forum](https://forum.camunda.org) or ask the teaching team in case of questions.
- Adapt the example to a small custom workflow that is relevant for you (and adapt the worker script). Maybe some data can be fetched from a [remote API](https://apilist.fun)?
- Publish the BPMN diagram and the worker code together with your notes in a separate folder in a forked repository and open a Pull Request to this repository with your changes

## Tips:

- Should you a direct URL of the deployed Camunda Engine not work, visit the root page, i.e. `localhost:8080` and navigate from there
- If prompted for a login, use `demo/demo`
- I've run into an issue with `external forms` and opened an issue on the Camunda Forum: https://forum.camunda.org/t/quick-start-guide-out-of-date-404-on-external-form/27314

# Things we found

- Camunda Platform credentials `demo/demo` are not clearly communicated at the Camunda site
